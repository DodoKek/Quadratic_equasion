# Quadratic_equation
## Overview
Meet the true approach for solving quadratic equation. With this tiny program you can easily solve:
- Quadratic equations
- Linear equations
- Round equations

It also includes a libraries, which allow you to:
- Read command line arguments
- Run unit tests on my poor program
- Write logs of executing functions 

The program is separated on files, that's why make file is included.

## Installation
First and foremost you need to clone the repo and build the project with makefile. <br/>

`git clone https://github.com/dodokek/Quadratic_equation.git`                             
`cd Quadratic_equation/src`                                                                   
`make`                                                                                    





              



This project solves quadratic equation. .exe file supports console arguments <br>
/h, -h, --help - Stands for getting some help by redirecting you to documentation<br>
/t, -t, --test - Stands for running Unit tests which you can modify in specified file.
